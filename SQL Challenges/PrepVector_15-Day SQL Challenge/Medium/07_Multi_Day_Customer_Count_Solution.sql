#Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.
#Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.
#Note: If a customer purchased multiple products on the same day, it does not count as an upsell. 
#An upsell is considered only if they made purchases on separate days

#Output Schema:

#Column                     Type
#upsold_customer_count        INT
